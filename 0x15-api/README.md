API - Application Programming Interface
--------------------------------------------
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It defines a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them â€“ access and modify their data

What a RESTful API IS
-----------------------
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used in APIs. It uses standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST is the most popular API architecture for transferring data over the internet. In a RESTful context, resources are accessible via endpoints, and operations are performed on those resources with standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
